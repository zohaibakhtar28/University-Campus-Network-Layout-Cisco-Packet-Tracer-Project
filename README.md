# University-Campus-Network-Layout-Cisco-Packet-Tracer-Project
# Overview
This project involves designing and prototyping a network topology for a large university with two campuses using Cisco Packet Tracer. The aim is to provide robust network connectivity and support for various departments and faculties, ensuring seamless communication and resource sharing.

# Network Layout Brief
The university has two campuses situated 20 miles apart. The network design needs to cater to students and staff distributed across four faculties: Health and Science, Business, Engineering/Computing, and Art/Design. Each staff member has a PC, while students have access to PCs in the labs.

Main Campus
Building A:
Administrative staff in the departments of Management, HR, and Finance.
Faculty of Business.
Building B:
Faculty of Engineering and Computing.
Faculty of Art and Design.
Building C:
Student lab and IT department.
University web server and other internal servers.
External email server hosted on the cloud.

Smaller Campus
Faculty of Health and Science:
Staff offices and student labs situated on different floors.

# Requirements
Separate IP networks for each department/faculty.
VLAN configuration for switches with appropriate security settings.
End-to-end connectivity and access to internal and external servers.
Core device configuration and essential end devices setup in Cisco Packet Tracer.

# Tasks
Task 1: Planning, Designing, and Prototyping

->Plan the Network Topology:

Identify the key components and their locations.

Determine the IP addressing scheme for each department/faculty.

Design the network layout ensuring optimal connectivity and security.

Design the Network Topology in Cisco Packet Tracer:

-> Main Campus:

Building A: Network setup for administrative staff and the Faculty of Business.

Building B: Network setup for the Faculty of Engineering/Computing and Art/Design.

Building C: Network setup for the student lab, IT department, and internal servers.

-> Smaller Campus:

Network setup for the Faculty of Health and Science.

Configure core and edge devices including routers, switches, and access points.

-> Prototype the Network:

Implement the designed topology in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Test connectivity between devices and ensure proper network segmentation.

Task 2: Configuration

-> Configure Devices:

Assign IP addresses to devices based on the planned scheme.

Set up VLANs on switches to segment network traffic.

Configure routing between different VLANs and campuses.

Apply security settings such as ACLs and port security.

-> Test Connectivity:

Verify end-to-end connectivity between devices within the same campus and across campuses.

Ensure access to internal servers from all relevant devices.

Test connectivity to the external email server hosted on the cloud.

# Documentation:

-> Document the IP addressing scheme, VLAN configuration, and security settings.
Create a topology diagram with detailed labels for all network components.

# Deliverables

-> Network Topology Diagram: A detailed diagram showing the layout of the network including all buildings and their respective departments/faculties.
Configuration Files: Exported configuration files for all network devices.

-> Documentation: Comprehensive documentation covering the network design, IP addressing scheme, VLANs, security settings, and testing results.

-> Cisco Packet Tracer: For designing, prototyping, and testing the network topology.

# Conclusion
This project aims to create a scalable and secure network for a large university spread across two campuses. By following the specified tasks and utilizing Cisco Packet Tracer, the designed network will provide robust connectivity and support the university's operational needs effectively.
